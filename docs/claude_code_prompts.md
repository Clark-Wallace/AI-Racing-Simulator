# Claude Code Prompts for AI Car Racing Simulator

## üèéÔ∏è **Prompt 1: Core Racing Engine Setup**

```
I'm building an AI car racing simulator where 5 different AI agents compete as racing cars. Each agent has different racing characteristics (speed-focused, technical-focused, etc.). 

Create a Python class structure for:
1. A RacingCar class that represents each AI racer with attributes like:
   - top_speed, acceleration, handling, fuel_efficiency 
   - driver_style (aggressive, conservative, balanced, technical, chaotic)
   - current_position, lap_time, total_race_time
2. A RaceTrack class with different track types:
   - speed_track (favors high top speed)
   - technical_track (favors handling and precision) 
   - mixed_track (balanced requirements)
   - endurance_track (favors fuel efficiency)
3. Methods for simulating race performance based on car stats vs track requirements

Include realistic racing physics calculations for speed, cornering, and fuel consumption. Make it modular so I can easily add new car types and track types.
```

## üèÅ **Prompt 2: Race Performance Metrics System**

```
I need a comprehensive performance metrics system for my AI car racing simulator. Each racing car should collect detailed telemetry data during races that becomes "prize data" for winners.

Create a Python system that tracks these racing metrics:

**Speed Metrics:**
- top_speed_achieved, average_speed, speed_consistency
- acceleration_0_to_60, burst_speed_capability

**Handling Metrics:** 
- cornering_efficiency, steering_precision, stability_rating
- drift_coefficient, braking_control

**Efficiency Metrics:**
- fuel_efficiency, energy_consumption_rate, pit_stop_frequency
- endurance_rating, resource_optimization

**Strategic Metrics:**
- overtaking_ability, defensive_maneuvers, risk_tolerance
- adaptability_index, race_intelligence

**Technical Metrics:**
- response_latency, consistency_variance, error_rate
- recovery_speed, technical_precision

The system should calculate these metrics in real-time during races and store them in a structured format. Winners get access to losers' telemetry data as prizes. Include methods to analyze and compare competitor data.
```

## üéÆ **Prompt 3: Racing Challenge Generator**

```
Create a racing challenge generator for my AI car racing simulator. I need a system that creates different types of racing challenges that test different aspects of the AI racers.

Build a RaceChallengeGenerator class that can create:

**Speed Challenges:**
- Drag races (pure acceleration/top speed)
- Time trials (fastest lap time)
- Sprint races (short distance, high intensity)

**Technical Challenges:**
- Precision driving (tight cornering, exact timing)
- Obstacle courses (complex navigation)
- Weather conditions (rain, fog affecting visibility/handling)

**Strategic Challenges:**
- Fuel management races (limited fuel, pit stop strategy)
- Endurance races (performance consistency over time)
- Pursuit races (catch the leader scenarios)

**Mixed Challenges:**
- Formula races (balanced speed + technical + strategy)
- Elimination races (last place eliminated each lap)
- Relay races (team-based competitions)

Each challenge should have configurable difficulty, track conditions, and success criteria. Include a scoring system that weights different performance aspects based on challenge type.
```

## üèÜ **Prompt 4: Data Prize Distribution System**

```
I need a data prize system for my AI racing simulator where race winners get access to competitor performance data as rewards.

Create a DataPrizeSystem that implements this distribution:
- 1st place: Gets own data + 4th place + 5th place data
- 2nd place: Gets own data + 4th place data  
- 3rd place: Gets own data + 5th place data
- 4th place: Gets only own data
- 5th place: Gets only own data

The system should:
1. Calculate finishing positions after each race
2. Determine data access rights based on positions
3. Grant/revoke access to competitor telemetry data
4. Track who has access to whose data over time
5. Provide methods for winners to analyze competitor data
6. Include data visualization tools to compare performance metrics

Winners should be able to use competitor data to identify weaknesses, predict behavior patterns, and develop counter-strategies for future races. Include a "spy network" visualization showing who has access to whose data.
```

## üöó **Prompt 5: AI Racing Agent Personas**

```
Create 5 distinct AI racing agent personas for my car racing simulator. Each should have unique characteristics, strategies, and behaviors.

Design these racing personalities:

**SpeedDemon:**
- Characteristics: Maximum speed, aggressive driving, risk-taking
- Strengths: Straight-line speed, overtaking, burst acceleration  
- Weaknesses: Cornering, fuel efficiency, consistency
- Strategy: Go fast, worry about consequences later

**TechPrecision:**
- Characteristics: Perfect technique, conservative approach, calculated risks
- Strengths: Cornering, braking, consistency, technical tracks
- Weaknesses: Top speed, aggressive overtaking, adapting to chaos
- Strategy: Smooth, precise, error-free driving

**FuelMaster:**
- Characteristics: Efficiency-focused, strategic thinking, endurance specialist
- Strengths: Fuel management, long races, strategic planning
- Weaknesses: Sprint races, burst speed, aggressive competition
- Strategy: Optimize for overall race performance, not lap times

**AdaptiveRacer:**
- Characteristics: Balanced approach, learns from competitors, flexible strategy
- Strengths: Versatility, learning, adapting to track conditions
- Weaknesses: No single dominant strength, can be indecisive
- Strategy: Analyze competitors and adapt strategy mid-race

**ChaosCruiser:**
- Characteristics: Unpredictable, creative approaches, high-risk/high-reward
- Strengths: Surprising moves, clutch performance, creative solutions
- Weaknesses: Consistency, predictability, sometimes crashes spectacularly
- Strategy: Keep everyone guessing, embrace the unexpected

Include methods for each agent to make racing decisions based on their personality, current race position, and available competitor data.

## üìä **Prompt 6: Race Simulation Engine**

```
Build a realistic race simulation engine for my AI car racing simulator that can run complete races between multiple AI agents.

Create a RaceSimulator class that:

**Race Mechanics:**
- Simulates lap-by-lap racing with realistic timing
- Handles different track types and weather conditions
- Manages fuel consumption, tire wear, and car performance degradation
- Implements overtaking scenarios and defensive maneuvers
- Includes random events (crashes, mechanical issues, safety cars)

**Agent Decision Making:**
- Each AI racer makes decisions based on their personality and strategy
- Considers current position, fuel levels, competitor proximity
- Adapts strategy based on race conditions and available competitor data
- Implements risk/reward calculations for overtaking attempts

**Real-time Updates:**
- Provides live race updates and position changes
