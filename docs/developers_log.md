#### üîß Technical Decisions:

1. **Data Classes**: Used Python dataclasses for clean, immutable data structures
2. **Enums**: Used enums for driver styles and track types for type safety
3. **Physics Model**: Implemented simplified but realistic physics:
   - Cornering speed: v = sqrt(Œº * g * r)
   - Acceleration/deceleration based on real car performance
   - Tire and fuel effects on performance
4. **Modular Design**: Separated cars and tracks into independent modules

#### üêõ Problems Encountered:

   - Solution: Added auto-calculation in __post_init__

2. **Performance Balance**: Initial style modifiers were too extreme
   - Solution: Tuned modifiers to be more subtle (5-15% differences)

#### üìù Notes for Future Development:
